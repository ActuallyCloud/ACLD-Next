# ACLD - Next
This repository contains the code files for the current version of my development website. It was created using Next.js, a framework for React, along with a combination of HTML/CSS. This repository also includes cypress for demonstration and dev testing. It is based on the create-next-app template provided by Next.js and is currently hosted on the Azure Cloud Platform using Azure's Static Web App platform.

# Notes
