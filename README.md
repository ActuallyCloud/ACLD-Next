# ACLD-Next Overview
This repository contains the files and server that currently run my website. It was built with Next.js, a framework for React, and plain HTML/CSS. Currently, the website is hosted on a Ubuntu Linux cloud server.

This project was created from the create-next-app template that is offered by Vercel. The project files are located under the with-cypress-app folder.
