# ACLD - Next
This repository contains the code files for the current version of my development website. It was created using Next.js, a framework for React, along with a combination of HTML/CSS. This repository also includes cypress for demonstration and dev testing. It is based on the create-next-app template provided by Next.js and is currently hosted on a Ubuntu Linux cloud server.

# Notes
- This repository is provided as a review of my code, so it is not the best resource for learning Next.js. For help with learning Next.js, check out [the create-next-app template](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app) offered by Next.js.
